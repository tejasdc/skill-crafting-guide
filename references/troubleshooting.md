# Troubleshooting Guide

## Skill Will Not Upload

### Name/Folder Mismatch (CRITICAL -- Most Common Breaking Error)

**Symptom:** Skill uploads but never loads, or loads inconsistently. May produce no error message at all.

**Cause:** The `name` field in frontmatter does not match the folder name.

**Example:**
```
# Folder is: ios-app-store-launch/
# But frontmatter says:
name: launching-ios-app    # WRONG - does not match folder

# Fix:
name: ios-app-store-launch  # CORRECT - matches folder exactly
```

**Solution:** Make the `name` field in YAML frontmatter identical to the folder name. If you want a different name, rename the folder too.

**Prevention:** Always verify after creating a skill: `basename $(pwd)` should match the `name` field exactly.

### Error: "Could not find SKILL.md in uploaded folder"

**Cause:** File not named exactly SKILL.md (case-sensitive).

**Solution:**
- Rename to SKILL.md (case-sensitive)
- Verify with: `ls -la` -- should show SKILL.md

### Error: "Invalid frontmatter"

**Cause:** YAML formatting issue.

**Common mistakes:**

```yaml
# Wrong - missing delimiters
name: my-skill
description: Does things

# Wrong - unclosed quotes
name: my-skill
description: "Does things

# Correct
---
name: my-skill
description: Does things
---
```

### Error: "Invalid skill name"

**Cause:** Name has spaces or capitals.

```yaml
# Wrong
name: My Cool Skill

# Correct
name: my-cool-skill
```

## Skill Does Not Trigger

**Symptom:** Skill never loads automatically.

**Fix:** Revise your description field. See `description-examples.md` for good and bad examples.

**Quick checklist:**
- Is it too generic? ("Helps with projects" will not work)
- Does it include trigger phrases users would actually say?
- Does it mention relevant file types if applicable?

**Debugging approach:** Ask Claude: "When would you use the [skill name] skill?" Claude will quote the description back. Adjust based on what is missing.

## Skill Triggers Too Often

**Symptom:** Skill loads for unrelated queries.

**Solutions:**

1. **Add negative triggers:**

```yaml
description: Advanced data analysis for CSV files. Use for
  statistical modeling, regression, clustering. Do NOT use for
  simple data exploration (use data-viz skill instead).
```

2. **Be more specific:**

```yaml
# Too broad
description: Processes documents

# More specific
description: Processes PDF legal documents for contract review
```

3. **Clarify scope:**

```yaml
description: PayFlow payment processing for e-commerce. Use
  specifically for online payment workflows, not for general
  financial queries.
```

## Instructions Not Followed

**Symptom:** Skill loads but Claude does not follow instructions.

**Common causes:**

### 1. Instructions too verbose
- Keep instructions concise
- Use bullet points and numbered lists
- Move detailed reference to separate files in references/

### 2. Instructions buried
- Put critical instructions at the top
- Use `## Important` or `## Critical` headers
- Repeat key points if needed

### 3. Ambiguous language

```
# Bad
Make sure to validate things properly

# Good
CRITICAL: Before calling create_project, verify:
- Project name is non-empty
- At least one team member assigned
- Start date is not in the past
```

### 4. Model "laziness"

Add explicit encouragement:

```markdown
## Performance Notes
- Take your time to do this thoroughly
- Quality is more important than speed
- Do not skip validation steps
```

Note: Adding this to user prompts is more effective than in SKILL.md.

**Advanced technique:** For critical validations, bundle a script that performs the checks programmatically rather than relying on language instructions. Code is deterministic; language interpretation is not.

## MCP Connection Issues

**Symptom:** Skill loads but MCP calls fail.

**Checklist:**

1. **Verify MCP server is connected**
   - Claude.ai: Settings, then Extensions, then [Your Service]
   - Should show "Connected" status

2. **Check authentication**
   - API keys valid and not expired
   - Proper permissions/scopes granted
   - OAuth tokens refreshed

3. **Test MCP independently**
   - Ask Claude to call MCP directly (without skill)
   - "Use [Service] MCP to fetch my projects"
   - If this fails, the issue is MCP configuration, not the skill

4. **Verify tool names**
   - Skill references correct MCP tool names
   - Check MCP server documentation
   - Tool names are case-sensitive

---

## Large Context Issues

**Symptom:** Skill seems slow or responses degraded.

**Causes:**
- Skill content too large
- Too many skills enabled simultaneously
- All content loaded instead of progressive disclosure

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize SKILL.md size**
   - Move detailed docs to references/
   - Link to references instead of inline
   - Keep SKILL.md under 5,000 words

2. **Reduce enabled skills**
   - Evaluate if you have more than 20-50 skills enabled simultaneously
   - Recommend selective enablement
   - Consider skill "packs" for related capabilities

---

## Execution Issues

**Symptom:** Inconsistent results, API call failures, user corrections needed.

**Solution:** Improve instructions, add error handling.

- Add specific error messages and recovery steps
- Include validation at each stage
- Provide fallback behavior when services are unavailable
